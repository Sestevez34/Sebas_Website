            <p> To be honest the first 4 colleges, considering my stats are reaches, but they all give great financial aid so I thouht that it would be worth a shot.
                I applied to most of these schools with the intention of declaring civil engineering, but I remembered that Physics is for the devil and would no longer decide to pursue it
                I'm going with computer science as my major because honestly I'm interested in so many of the fields subsets.
                <ul>
                    <li>Data science</li>
                    <li>Game Development</li>
                    <li>Cybersecurity</li>
                    <li>Imbedded Systems</li>
                </ul>
                All interest me and all happen to be greatly involved in math,<i> the reason I dropped Physics</i>, but also computers are kind of cool so &#129335
